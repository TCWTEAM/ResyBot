# RESY BOT

## Resy Bot with captcha bypass, proxy support, no rate-limiting

### NOTE

#### THIS DOESN'T INCLUDE OUR TOOLKIT; NEED MONGO, REDIS, AND AN ACCOUNT GEN

### What is this?
#### this is the automation engine component of a drunken resy bot I made with my friends a while back. Includes a captcha "solution", optimizations, rate limiting fix and more but *NOTE* -- it is outdated and is missing infrastructure that made this run, and may not work in the current state. An easy way to get this working locally is patching resy/[account,acc_preloader,database].py and updating the network info in resy/network.py.
