# RESY BOT

## Resy Bot with captcha bypass, proxy support, no rate-limiting

### NOTE

#### THIS DOESN'T INCLUDE OUR TOOLKIT; NEED MONGO, REDIS, AND AN ACCOUNT BANK

### What is this?
#### this is the automation engine component of a drunken resy bot I made with my friends a while back. Includes a captcha "solution", optimizations, rate limiting fix and more but *NOTE* -- it is outdated and is missing infrastructure that made this run, and may not work in the current state. An easy way to get this working locally is patching resy/[account,acc_preloader,database].py and updating the network info in resy/network.py. 

### Plans?
#### theres no plan to develop this out further but it does include alot of good learning material and may be useful for your own projects. this also shouldve been written in GO but python allowed super fast scripting
